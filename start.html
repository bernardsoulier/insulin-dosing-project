    <h1>Starting insulin in insulin naive hyperglycemic patient</h1>
    <p>If resuming insulin started as outpatient, use previous insulin dosing as a starting point.  If the patient is a
        reliable historian and A1c is <8%, consider using the outpatient insulin doses without adjustment.
        Consider a decrease from this dose if current glucoses are on the lower side.</p>
    <p>If glucoses are markedly hyperglycemic and acute control is needed, consider using an insulin drip -
        EPIC order set (4769).</p>
    <p>If glucoses are hyperglycemic, but control can be obtained over a longer period of time, use this tool to guide
        insulin initiation.</p>
    <p>EPIC order set 5172 contains many subcutanous insulin ordering assets.</p><br><br>
